In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

  - Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

  - Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

  - Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

  - Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
